Generalized Sparse Convolution
==============================

Sparse Tensor
-------------

In traditional speech, text, or image data, features are extracted densely.
Thus, the most common representations of these data are vectors, matrices, and
tensors. However, for 3-dimensional scans or even higher-dimensional spaces,
such dense representations are inefficient due to the sparsity. Instead, we can
only save the non-empty part of the space as its coordinates and the associated
features. This representation is an N-dimensional extension of a sparse matrix;
thus it is known as a sparse tensor.

In the Minkowski Engine, we adopt the same sparse tensor for the basic data
representation and the class is provided in
:attr:`MinkowskiEngine.SparseTensor`. We use the COOrdinate (COO) format to
save a sparse tensor `[1]
<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/papers/2016/parker-thesis.pdf>`_. This
representation is simply a concatenation of coordinates in a matrix :math:`C`
and associated features :math:`F`.

.. math::

   \mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
   x_1^1   & x_1^2  & \cdots & x_1^D  & b_1    \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   x_N^1   & x_N^2  & \cdots & x_N^D  & b_N
   \end{bmatrix}, \; \mathbf{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{f}_1^T\\
   \vdots\\
   \mathbf{f}_N^T
   \end{bmatrix}

In the above equation, we use a :math:`D`-dimensional space and :math:`N`
number of points, each with the coordinate :math:`(x_i^1, x_i^1, \cdots,
x_i^D)`, and the associated feature :math:`\mathbf{f}_i`. :math:`b_i` indicates
the mini-batch index to disassociate instances within the same batch.
Internally, we handle the batch index as an additional spatial dimension.


Generalized Sparse Convolution
------------------------------

The convolution is a fundamental operation in many fields. In image perception,
the 2D convolution has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks and
is proven to be the most crucial operation in AI, and computer vision research.
In this work, we adopt the sparse convolution `[2]
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10275>`_ and propose the generalized sparse
convolution. We use the generalized sparse convolution not only to the 3D
spatial axes, but also to the temporal axis, which is proven to be more
effective than recurrent neural networks (RNN) in some applications.

Specifically, we generalize the sparse convolution for generic input and
output coordinates, and for arbitrary kernel shapes. The generalized sparse
convolution encompasses not only all sparse convolutions but also the
conventional dense convolutions. Let :math:`x^{\text{in}}_\mathbf{u} \in
\mathbb{R}^{N^\text{in}}` be an :math:`N^\text{in}`-dimensional input feature
vector in a :math:`D`-dimensional space at :math:`\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^D`
(a D-dimensional coordinate), and convolution kernel weights be
:math:`\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{K^D \times N^\text{out} \times N^\text{in}}`.
We break down the weights into spatial weights with :math:`K^D` matrices of
size :math:`N^\text{out} \times N^\text{in}` as :math:`W_\mathbf{i}` for
:math:`|\{\mathbf{i}\}_\mathbf{i}| = K^D`. Then, the conventional dense
convolution in D-dimension is

.. math::
   \mathbf{x}^{\text{out}}_\mathbf{u} = \sum_{\mathbf{i} \in \mathcal{V}^D(K)} W_\mathbf{i} \mathbf{x}^{\text{in}}_{\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{i}} \text{ for } \mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{Z}^D,

where :math:`\mathcal{V}^D(K)` is the list of offsets in :math:`D`-dimensional
hypercube centered at the origin. e.g. :math:`\mathcal{V}^1(3)=\{-1, 0, 1\}`.
The generalized sparse convolution in the following equation relaxes the above
equation.

.. math::
   \mathbf{x}^{\text{out}}_\mathbf{u} = \sum_{\mathbf{i} \in \mathcal{N}^D(\mathbf{u}, \mathcal{C}^{\text{in}})} W_\mathbf{i} \mathbf{x}^{\text{in}}_{\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{i}} \text{ for } \mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{C}^{\text{out}}

where :math:`\mathcal{N}^D` is a set of offsets that define the shape of a
kernel and :math:`\mathcal{N}^D(\mathbf{u}, \mathcal{C}^\text{in})=
\{\mathbf{i} | \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{i} \in \mathcal{C}^\text{in}, \mathbf{i}
\in \mathcal{N}^D \}` as the set of offsets from the current center,
:math:`\mathbf{u}`, that exist in :math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{in}`.
:math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{in}` and :math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{out}` are predefined
input and output coordinates of sparse tensors. First, note that the input
coordinates and output coordinates are not necessarily the same.  Second, we
define the shape of the convolution kernel arbitrarily with
:math:`\mathcal{N}^D`. This generalization encompasses many special cases such
as the dilated convolution and typical hypercubic kernels. Another interesting
special case is the sparse submanifold convolution when we set
:math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{out} = \mathcal{C}^\text{in}` and :math:`\mathcal{N}^D
= \mathcal{V}^D(K)`. If we set :math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{in} =
\mathcal{C}^\text{out} = \mathbb{Z}^D` and :math:`\mathcal{N}^D =
\mathcal{V}^D(K)`, the generalized sparse convolution becomes the conventional
dense convolution.  If we define the :math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{in}` and
:math:`\mathcal{C}^\text{out}` as multiples of a natural number and
:math:`\mathcal{N}^D = \mathcal{V}^D(K)`, we have a strided dense convolution.
